CuraProfileCompare 0.0.1 - to visualy compare two Ultimaker Cura profiles 
===========================================~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// code by aleksandarpu@gmail.com

CuraProfileCompare is Qt5 python application that allow visual compararison of the two
*.curaprofile files.


Available binaries
-------------------
CuraProfileCompare require python3.6+ and Qt5
CuraProfileCompare.tar.gz contains bundle made with pyinstaller for Linux
CuraProfileCompare is also generated with pyinstaller but with option --onefile
CuraProfileCompare.zip contains bundle made with pyinstaller for Windows

Running the utility
-------------------
This is a simple GUI application to load and compare 2 files
First, click 'Load A file' and content will be displayed in tables.
This will enable 'Load B file' button.
When second files are loaded, in the table you will see 'A value' and 'B value' columns.
A is from first file and B is from second one.

The *.curaprofile files are zip archive files with 2 files added in.
Each file has config file (*.ini0 structure with 3 sections:
[general], [metadata] and [values]
This is displayed in 'Section' column in tables
Because of two files with similar content I can't assume right pairing for comparison 
and thus I added 'Swap sections' button to swap B files from upper table to lower and vice verse.

I hope this app will help to someone dealing with Cura profiles

Any suggestion is welcome.
If you have idea for better way to display profiles let me know

P.S. Future fix will include proper sorting of displayed rows by property name.
